Description
Hello, I'm Sam Min Thant from Myanmar. I am pleased to present my final project, a web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project explores fascinating facts about planets in our solar system. Users can engage with the content through an interactive quiz, making the learning experience both informative and enjoyable.
